![TensorFlow](https://img.shields.io/badge/TensorFlow-%23FF6F00.svg?style=flat&logo=TensorFlow&logoColor=white)  
The task was to develop a model for classifying images and to train it to distinguish between 14 classes of leaves. Project developed during the course of Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning at the Polytechnic University of Milan.
#### [`Masters of Renaissance - Board game`](https://github.com/redaellimattia/Progetto-SWE-2021) 
![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/Java-%23ED8B00.svg?style=flat&logo=java&logoColor=white)  
Software Engineering Final Project - `BSc thesis`.  
Modeling a board game as software, enabling remotely played games using sockets, and implementing all game rules. Playable both from `CLI` and `GUI`. Developed using `Java`, and `JavaFX` for the `GUI`. Implemented using Model View Controller architectural pattern (`MVC`).
#### [`edU, or ed with multiple undo`](https://github.com/redaellimattia/Progetto-API-2020)  
![C](https://img.shields.io/badge/-C-61DAFB?logo=C&logoColor=white&style=flat)  
Algorithms and data structures project. The project consists in a text editor written in `C`, with the possibility of performing multiple undo and redo, during insertions, as well as the usual printing and deleting.
